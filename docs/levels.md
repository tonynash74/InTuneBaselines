# Levels: L1 vs L2

- **L1**: Minimum Cyber Essentials-aligned baseline for in-scope devices.
- **L2**: Hardened variant for higher-risk users/devices (admins, sensitive data).

Both L1 and L2 are **full baselines**, not diffs. The distinction is encoded in the folder structure and
in the Intune policy `displayName` (e.g. `Android-BYOD-L1-Compliance-Baseline-2025-04`).

Populate settings according to the Cyber Essentials and NCSC mappings in the other docs.
