# iOS baselines (scaffold)

Folders:

- `baselines/L1/ios` – L1 BYOD + Corporate baselines.
- `baselines/L2/ios` – L2 hardened variants.

This scaffold includes:

- Compliance policy JSONs (`iosCompliancePolicy`).
- Minimal `.mobileconfig` profiles for BYOD and Corporate (L1 + L2) you can extend with concrete settings.

The `.mobileconfig` payloads should be edited to add concrete Restrictions / Passcode keys
based on your Cyber Essentials and NCSC-aligned requirements.
